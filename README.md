#  Particle Swarm Optimizer
Step 1: Modify CostFunc function from PSOmodule1. (Note that the constraints should be defined as penalty terms and be added to the objective function)

Step 2: Modify the upper and lower bounds of the variables.

Step 3: Run PSO1.jl

There is no memory allocation in the current version of the code. However, I believe it can be further optimized. I appreciate your contributions and inputs to make the code faster.
